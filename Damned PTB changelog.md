# V1.03 CHANGELOG:





 :exclamation: **General**
- Disabled the use of the Escape key in lobby as it was the culprit of bugging out lobbies so that you may no longer click anything.








 :flashlight: **BALANCE CHANGES**

Added more trap spawns to the maps listed below:

- Black Lake Asylum
- Black Lake Woods
- Bright Hotel
- Factory
- Tyberg Hospital
- Serenity Asylum


*WAREHOUSE*

- This map originally had a poor distribution of traps (some traps being grouped up in clusters of up to 8 at a time) and as such been moderately reworked. Information below:

1. 8 clocks replaced with non-trap clock variants (in the clock room)
2. 5 timers removed, 4 traps added (in the oven timer/shelf room, AKA spawn point)
3. 10 pianos replaced with 10 non-trap piano variants, 3 traps added (in the room with multiple safes stacked as a tower)
4. 12 traps added to empty room (room before the clock room, which originally had 2 traps)

trap net change: -3<<



*TRAP CHANGES*
- Percentage modifier (percent of traps that activate on a map per shift) has been modified on all maps for fallen as a result of adding more traps, or not having enough.

 - Added "Companion planks". Companion planks are wooden plank entities that appear after dismantling a barricade from a door, which was originally a feature but eventually stopped working - now they are back.

- Moved an ouja board near the pianos to be propped up against them instead of on the middle of the floor (so mary can walk by more easily)
- Moved an ouja board in the 2nd dining hall off the floor and onto a table (so that mary can walk by more easily)


☆ Serenity Asylum ☆

- Created a miniature makeshift passage on the 2nd floor and aligned room A101 to it (this was done because room A101 originally clipped through the staircase leading to the 3rd floor, and thus the exit, but mary could not walk over it. these changes were to make it so that she can)
