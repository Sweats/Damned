# Damned
A repository for updating an abandoned game that is on Steam.

# What is this repository?

This repository is used to keep track of changes that the community has made to the game. Currently it is only possible to add in new maps into the game.
Tools will be written to streamline the process of adding in new maps into the game. As of right now, it's a little tedious to add in a new map.

For more information, see this post on the Steam community forums:

Do not download the zip file because the latest changes will always be here. You can download the zip file from here.

# TODO:
 
Here is a list of things that we have in mind to create so far:
	- Create a GUI that acts like a steam workshop for browsing and downloading maps and installing them into the game.
	- Figure out how to import new objects into the game.
	- Write a bot that can fetch public lobbies and post them into the Discord. This would be better than launching the game and seeing if there are any public lobbies.
