# Damned
A repository for updating a game on Steam called Damned.


# What is this repository?



This repository is used to keep track of changes that the community has made to the game.
Tools will be written to streamline the process of adding in patches that contain new maps and balance changes into the game.



For more information, see this post on the Steam community forums:


https://steamcommunity.com/app/251170/discussions/0/1700542968204133958/


Do not download the zip file on the steam post because the latest changes will always be here. You can download the zip file from here.

# Communication

We communicate on Discord. The link is https://discord.gg/hEKaz5m

# TODO:
 
Here is a list of things that we have in mind to create so far:

	- Create a GUI that acts like a steam workshop for browsing and downloading maps and installing them into the game, and also streamline the process of installing the level editor.
	
	- Figure out how to import new objects into the game.
	
	- Write a bot that can fetch public lobbies and post them into the Discord. This would be better than launching the game
	and seeing if there are any public lobbies.
	
	
	
Here is a list of things that will for sure happen in a future patch:

	- Phantom rebalancing
	
	- New maps
	
	
	
Here is a list of things that may or may not happen in a future patch:

	- Monster inclusive chat in game	
	
	- In game hyperlinks to patch notes and the community discord
	
	- New monster (dependent on successfully importing a model into the game, and the coding changes necessary)
