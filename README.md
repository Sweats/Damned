# Damned
A repository for updating a game on Steam called Damned.


# What is this repository?



This repository is used to keep track of changes that the community has made to the game.
Tools will be written to streamline the process of adding in patches that contain new maps and balance changes into the game.



For more information, see this post on the Steam community forums:

Do not download the zip file on the steam post because the latest changes will always be here. You can download the zip file from here.

# Communication

We communicate on Discord. The link is https://discord.gg/hEKaz5m

# TODO:
 
Here is a list of things that we have in mind to create so far:
	- Create a GUI that acts like a steam workshop for browsing and downloading maps and installing them into the game.
	- Figure out how to import new objects into the game.
	- Write a bot that can fetch public lobbies and post them into the Discord. This would be better than launching the game and seeing if there are any public lobbies.

# V1.00 CHANGELOG:

General

- Added a new Community-made Map 'Pog Champ Hotel'

- Added a new Community-made Map 'Hund Hills Community Center'

- Debug Console now displays a list of Maps and their internal ID



Fallen

- Traps needed for Seeker Form (P2) = 10, instead of random between 9 and 12

- Seeker (P2) starts transforming to Destroyer (P3) when a Survivor is within 6m line-of-sight, instead of previous 10m

- Seeker Form (P2) can now see Humans

- Destroyer Form (P3) now lasts for 30s, up from 7s

- While in Destroyer Form, press E button to phase out of Destroyer into Trapper Form and revert back into Destroyer after 3s assuming your 30s Form Time didn't elapse yet.

This ability has a cooldown of 5s (8s if you count the 3s of phasing time).



Phantom

- Changed background music when you are survivor and Phantom sees you from 'Run!' (monster_closer) to 'Kill!' (blind_hearing)
